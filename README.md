## MySQL Schema (MySQL Workbench)

I added a MySQL schema file at `db/schema_mysql.sql` you can import into MySQL Workbench.

Steps:

1. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your server.
2. From the File menu choose "Open SQL Script" and select `db/schema_mysql.sql`.
3. Run the script to create the `alpha_fx_trader` database and sample data.

Tables included: `users`, `portfolios`, `trades`, `settings`.

If you want, I can add a small Node.js backend to persist trades to this MySQL database.
